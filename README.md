### 🌟 About Me

Hey there! I’m **GlitchyPixel**, a self-taught developer at the very beginning of my coding adventure. I spend my free time diving into the world of programming, tinkering with code, and building little things that spark my curiosity.

I’ve got a foundational grip on **Small Basic**, **C#**, **HTML5**, and **CSS**, and I’m always hungry to learn more. My heart, though, belongs to **game development**.

### 🎮 Game Development Journey

I started my game dev quest with **Unity**, which I absolutely loved… until they introduced the per-installation fee. That pushed me to explore other engines, and I found **Godot** — a breath of fresh air! I'm currently learning it and really enjoying the open-source, community-driven vibe.

### 💻 Tech I’m Exploring

* 🧠 **Programming Languages**: Small Basic, C#, HTML5, CSS
* 🕹️ **Game Engines**: Former Unity user, now leveling up in Godot
* 🐙 **GitHub**: Just discovered this magical labyrinth of repositories and I'm loving every overly-complex bit of it!

### 🚀 What Drives Me

I’m all about **learning through building**. Whether it’s games, apps, or experiments that go nowhere (yet), I start projects to learn new skills and technologies. I dream of collaborating with other developers and creators to sharpen my skills and bring cool ideas to life.

### 🤝 Let’s Collaborate!

Got a fun idea? Working on something exciting? I’d love to connect, learn, and build together. I’m especially interested in joining forces with other game or app devs—whether you’re a beginner like me or a seasoned pro.
